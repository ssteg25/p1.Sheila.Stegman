This is the Park East Living Elevator


Issues
It is not intuitive when I was trying to find the second floor button. In this interface, the third floor button is on the right of the first floor button, which is not practical. There is enough space for 4 buttons. It's easy to make a straight layout.

### Common Uses
- Push the button of the floor you’d like to go to
- Push the close/open door button

### Less Common Uses
- Pressing the emergency button

### Common Sequence of Action
1. Press call elevator on outside
2. Step into elevator
3. Push button for floor you’d like to go to
4. Optional: press close door for faster door closing
5. Wait for elevator to get to floor
6. Exit elevator

### Elevator Feedback
The use of lables on or next to buttons help the user know what each button does. Buttons lighting up gives the user confirmation they pressed a button. The elevator making a "ding" noise lets the user know they have reached a floor.

### What can be improved?
The Park East elevator does many things well but that is not the case for other elevators around the world. This elevator has an intuitive button design where the floors ascend vertically and there is clear labeling on each button for what it does. The only improvement I would add to this panel would be making the emergency button a different color although it can be argued that it has been differentiated enough from the other buttons. As for accessability, the button panel is at a good height where a wheelchair-bound person would be able to reach all buttons and the buttons are also in brail so a blind person could use it.

### My Improvement
This is a mock-up for my improvement where it's relatively the same but the labels for the floors are on the buttons and the emergency button is slightly moved more into the corner as it isn't used as often.

### My touchscreen elevator design
I came up with a design that has a screen but I didn't want to include the buttons on it as someone who is blind may not be able to tell what they are pressing. Everything printed on the screen is asumed to also be spoken (although not implemented into this project) for accessability. The panel size will be 1x2 feet and be at the same height as the Park East Living elevator is to stay in range for wheelchair users.
